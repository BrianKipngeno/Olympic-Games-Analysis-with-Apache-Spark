# Olympic-Games-Analysis-with-Apache-Spark

# 📌 **Overview**

This project focuses on analyzing Olympic Games data using Apache Spark to gain insights into athlete demographics, sports trends, and performance metrics. The dataset contains information on athletes, events, medals, and their participation across different Olympic years.

# 📂 **Dataset**

The dataset used in this project consists of historical records from the Olympic Games, covering attributes such as:

Athlete ID, Name, Sex

Age, Height, Weight

Team, NOC (National Olympic Committee)

Year, Season (Summer/Winter), City

Sport, Event, Medal (Gold, Silver, Bronze)

# 🛠 **Tech Stack**

Apache Spark (PySpark/Scala)

Databricks (for distributed data processing)

Python/Scala (for data manipulation)

Jupyter Notebook (for analysis and visualization)

Pandas & Matplotlib (for exploratory data analysis)

# 🚀 **Setup and Installation**

1. Install Apache Spark

2. Load the Dataset in Spark

3. Print the DataFrame Schema

# 📊 **Data Processing and Transformation**

Data Cleaning: Handling missing values and data type conversions.

Feature Engineering: Extracting insights like average age of medalists.

Aggregations: Finding the most successful countries and athletes.

Visualization: Creating charts for medal distributions and sports trends.


# 📈 **Key Insights**

The average age of Olympic athletes has increased over time.

Some countries consistently dominate certain sports.

Height and weight distribution vary significantly across sports.
